# CricketScoreCounter
It is my project, that will be submitted to Udacity Google's Reskilling India. This is project of Cricket Score Counter Application. In this project, it is given many features like, if player hit six marks, then it will be awarded six marks, respectively four, a run. Run means single. But if player run for 2 runs, then it shall be pressed two times. There is an button called extra. Extra button is used, whenever bowler give an extra run, like wide ball or no ball or leg by runs. It is initialized with one run and it will be treated as extra run. One more button is provided, and that is wicket. If player is out then the score shall be display for wicket also. It will be stop after 10 wickets is gone and display All out message. And at last there is a reset button which will reset our applications data.
